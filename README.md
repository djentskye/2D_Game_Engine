# Game Engine

Welcome! This is a game engine I've been working on in my spare time. I put the core of it together around 2020, but I've since started overhauling it in preparation for an upcoming project. It's still in pretty early beta stages, so unless you are quite familiar with C++ and SDL, this repository may be hard to follow. 

Everything in this game engine is built to be reasonably modular, so it should never be particularly hard to implement additional features. 

## Features

Currently, the game engine is being designed for both top-down RPG-style 2D visuals and bullet-hell style 2D visuals, along with gameplay functionality for both. This engine supports level loading, .cfg parsing, and several other convenient features. It's reasonably optimized in terms of performance, using multithreading and several other tricks to save on processing power, though it still needs more memory optimization. (Not a pressing concern)
